Like the blog? Support this effort by giving a star on [GitHub](https://github.com/pickerX/me).


### Requirements

1. Node 20
2. yarn

### Run
fork & clone & run,

1. yarn
2. yarn dev

done, open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) and enjoy!

if you have customized basePath in siteMetadata.js, add it following localhost:3000/

### Personal config

Open siteMetadata.js, configure any siteMetadata for personalizing.


### Github pages
Github support static html deploy. 

#### next.config

Modify next.config.js, add output: 'export' for auto building, it will generate output directory in project root contains all 
the static html, css, images resource etc.

And you also can add basePath here.

```js
    basePath: "/xxx",
    output: 'export',

```

Then, remove headers configuration due to NOT ALLOWED dynamic headers when building static codes.

```js
    // async headers() {
    //   return [
    //     {
    //       source: '/(.*)',
    //       headers: securityHeaders,
    //     },
    //   ]
    // },
```

#### Settings


After forking project, navigate to Settings -> pages -> Build and deployment section,   
and select Source GitHub Actions, then you can see the nextjs configure option, just click it.  

By the way, you can configure the domain you bought at the Custom domain section.


Next, you can find the sample workflow for building and deploying file with yml extension. Such as

``` yml
# Sample workflow for building and deploying a Next.js site to GitHub Pages
#
# To get started with Next.js see: https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started
#
name: Deploy Next.js site to Pages

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  push:
    branches: ["main"]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  # Build job
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

            echo "runner=yarn" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
            exit 0
          elif [ -f "${{ github.workspace }}/package.json" ]; then
            echo "manager=npm" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
            echo "command=ci" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
            echo "runner=npx --no-install" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
            exit 0
          else
            echo "Unable to determine package manager"
            exit 1
          fi

    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment

```

if you receive this error message, 

```
    The "next export" command has been removed in favor of "output: export" in next.config.js. Learn more: https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export
```

then, remove the following configuration in your nextjs.yml or ohter yml file in .github/workflows/ folder

```yml
  - name: Static HTML export with Next.js
  run: ${{ steps.detect-package-manager.outputs.runner }} next export
```

or, can build code on local environment when not sure code is all good. run,

``` shell
  yarn build

  ## All good when get
